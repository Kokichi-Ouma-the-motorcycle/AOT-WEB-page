        Isabel Mangolia and Farlan Church were killed by titans and Levi found their bbodies and vowed to kill all titans, and avenge his bestfriends. Isabel was like his little siter and Farlan was his brother.He is known as humanity's most powerful soldier and head of an elite squad in the Survey Corps. Hange remarks that he is a bit of a "clean freak".[26] While it is said that he is blunt and unapproachable, it is noted that he has a strong respect for authority, structure and discipline. (Man ran away from police twice) [volume & issue needed] The side story Attack on Titan: No Regrets focuses on Levi's origins, revealing that he was part of a band of thieves using the Vertical Maneuvering Equipment to commit crimes before he is scouted by Erwin to join the army. Captain Kenny Ackerman later notes that the capture of Eren and Historia has to do with Levi, whom he refers to as "Levi Ackerman".[ch. 56] Kenny is later revealed to be Levi's maternal uncle, who raised him after his mother Kuchel's death. Lately, in the Attack On Titan manga, Levi is said to be a victim of an explosion engineered by Zeke Yeager (brother of Eren Jaeger). He was in a near-death state until Hange Zoe found him and escaped with his body later to make an alliance with Commander Theo Magath and Pieck Finger in order to take down Eren Jaeger. Eventually, Levi recovers and joins the others in battle, managing to kill Zeke, fulfilling his promise to Erwin in killing the Beast Titan</center>
