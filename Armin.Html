            — Armin regrets the massacre at Liberio[4]
            Armin Arlelt (アルミン・アルレルト Arumin Arureruto?) is a soldier in the Scout Regiment. He is also a childhood friend of Eren Jaeger and Mikasa Ackermann, and is one of the two deuteragonists of the series. Although he appears to be the physically weakest of the 104th Cadet Corps, his high intelligence and strategic genius makes him an invaluable asset, though he does not consider himself to be one and is known to have low self-esteem. After the battle of Shiganshina District, he took the power of the Titans from Bertholdt Hoover and became the Colossal Titan.</center>
