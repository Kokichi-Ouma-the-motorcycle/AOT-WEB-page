    Mikasa is Eren's childhood friend who was taken in by his family. Though she was never officially adopted by the Jaeger family, she felt a strong sense of gratitude toward Eren's parents, though she never thought of them as her own. After she was orphaned by slave traders, Eren saved her life and gave her her iconic scarf. A normally quiet and withdrawn girl, she maintains a stoic expression except when it comes to Eren and her friends.[GB p. 36] As later revealed, Mikasa's father was a descendant of an Eldian bloodline that was modified to create super soldiers equal to a Titan in strength. When under duress, these genetically inherited abilities may allow a descendant access to their ancestors' battle experience. After Eren and his father discover The Ackermans' deaths during a routine doctor's visit, Eren tracks Mikasa to the trader's cabin. Mikasa's instincts are awakened when Eren urges her to 'fight back and live'.[ch. 6][ep 6] Because of this, and because of Eren's kindness in giving her a black (dark red in the anime) scarf which Mikasa treasures and wears her entire life, she feels compelled to protect and follow him at all costs, including joining him in the Survey Corps. She graduates from the Training Corps top of her class,[ch. 2] and is regarded by officers as an unprecedented genius and prodigy, easily worth a hundred men in battle.[vol. 3,4] Though technically half-blooded, she is the last known person of Asian descent residing in the Walls. A wrist tattoo inherited from her mother (which she keeps hidden from everyone except Eren) indicates that she is descended from the prominent Azumabito family (アズマビト家, Azumabito-ke), a cadet Shogun branch from the Oriental nation of Hizuru (ヒィズル, Hizuru), whose ancestors migrated from their native land to Paradis as honored ambassadors.[ch. 6][ep 6][GB p.39] While investigating the Volunteers alongside the Survey Corps, Eren tells Mikasa that he has always hated her for being a slave to her Ackerman blood. In turn, she becomes despondent and removes the black scarf off her neck. While still invested in Eren, Mikasa decides to join the alliance to stop Eren's planned genocide on the Marleyan enemies.
In the author's blog, Isayama notes that her name comes from the Mikasa, a famous pre-dreadnought battleship of the Imperial Japanese Navy.[6]
Mikasa is voiced by Yui Ishikawa in Japanese,[GB p.20] and Trina Nishimura in English dub.[7][8] In the live-action film, she is portrayed by Kiko Mizuhara.[5] Ishikawa says that Mikasa cares mainly about Eren, and keeps a distance from the rest of the world. She says that "While she might seem like a character with so few emotional levels, there are actually many feelings that swirl around her heart."[GB p.20]
